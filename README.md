Title: Spark versus Flink: Performance Comparisons in Big Data Analysis Framework

## Spark vs.Flink
Spark and Flink are two Apache -hosted data analytic frameworks that facilitate the analyzing of big datasets. The in-depth understanding of the underlying architecture choices are important to increase the performance of processing data with respect to different datasets. 

## Aim of ProjectThis project is aimed to justify the performance of Spark and Flink by evaluating their results by processing on streaming datasets; different benchmarks will be considered for this evaluation. 

Fault tolerance, a major aspect of stream processing will be discussed, and support for applications such as Machine Learning with respect to stream processing will be discussed.
